# kevs-gore

 A FiveM gore enhancement resource. I modified it from the original sp version to work on FiveM with some adjustments.

## Instructions

    1. add kevs-gore to resources folder

    2. ensure kevs-gore

## Notes

* kevs-gore utilizes the gta5.meta file to work. if you have any other resource that works this way, you will need to combine them as they won't be compatible with kevs-gore.
